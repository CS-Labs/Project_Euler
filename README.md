This repository contains my solutions to various Project Euler problems in a variety of different languages.

Disclaimer: I solve these problems to learn new languages for fun so my answers might not always follow the best practices of the languages I am writting. 

Note: Other non-featured languages are included in the 'Others' folder.

Current languages: C++, Haskell, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Rust.
